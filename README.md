# CustomVision - TensorFlow Lite Object Detection

Create from exporting the customvision model as tensorflow zip file with sample code.

-- When using a Raspberry Pi with a Raspberry Pi Camera, due to OpenCV (cv2), it requires legacy camera to be enabled in the raspi-config.

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run using:

```
python detect.py 
```

Expected performance is 1 FPS or less.
